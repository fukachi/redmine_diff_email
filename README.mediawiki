This plugin sends diff emails for each changeset pushed to a repository.

=== Installation ===

I confirmed the operation with Redmine version 4.1.0.  
I have not checked it, but I think it will work on redmine version 2.6 or later.  

To

  ./app/views/repositories/_form.html.erb

or (if you have the redmine SCM plugin installed) to

  ./plugins/redmine_scm/app/views/repositories/_form.html.erb

add the following:

 --- OLD
 +++ NEW
 @@ -23,6 +23,7 @@
    <%  button_disabled = ! @repository.class.scm_available %>
    <%= repository_field_tags(f, @repository) %>
  <% end %>
 +<%= call_hook(:view_repository_form) %>
  </div>
  <p>

Now follow the plugin installation procedure at http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Plugins#Installing-a-plugin .

=== Configuration ===

SomeProject -> "Settings" Tab -> "Repositories" Tab -> "Edit"

Once commit messages are enabled,
users fulfilling all of the following criteria will receive commit notifications per mail:

* users that are members of that project
* users with roles that are allowed to view changesets
* users that receive notifications for the corresponding project

To check whether you receive notifications for a certain project, check your account settings at the "My account" page
and make sure that "Email notifications" is set to "all projects" or "selected projects" respectively.
